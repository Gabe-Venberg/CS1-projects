# CS1 java projects

This repository is simply a record of the projects I did for my Computer Science 1 class.
As I didnt come up with the bright idea to put this in a git repository until after im halfway through Computer Science 2, the initial commit will be the only commit.

Feel free to look around, but keep in mind I was utterly unfamiliar with java at the time, and we were not allowed to 'read ahead' and use java classes we had not learned about yet.
